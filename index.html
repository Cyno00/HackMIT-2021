		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Smartphones and computers have become indispensible parts of our lives. We use them to learn, to conduct business, or just to watch movies and TV on Netflix or sus out the imposters in the popular video game Among Us.  Recently, Apple announced its iPhone 13 lineup, as well as new models of the iPad Mini and Apple Watch. Are you planning to upgrade? What will you do with your old device then? Keep it as a backup? Sell it to a recycling company? Trade it in with Apple to get a discount on your new phone? Sell it to a friend? Throw it away? We at [PROJECT NAME] hope that you do anything except throw it away in the trash.
  
		<br> <br> But the process in which Aluminum and Lithium metals turn into an iPhone is incredibly convoluted. That is not to say you should know about silicon etching, or the electrochemistry of lithium-ion batteries; but where do the raw materials come from? Who does the manufacturing labor? Where do old phones go when you return them to Apple? We as consumers are disconnected from the "black box", and make our purchases based on price alone. This helps us distance ourselves from the ugly face of capitalism and industrial society: the exploitation of the natural world and the underpreviledged. Truthfully, the carbon footprint of modern electronics is immense, and so are the ecological and ethical concerns of obtaining minerals like Tin and Cobalt. Through this project, we aim to raise awareness about the many problems that are yet to be solved in the production of consumer electronics, and to provide resources on how to recycle your device as a concrete way for you to do your part to keep the Earth livable for the coming years.
