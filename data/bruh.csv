Aluminum,Case,Common metal used in casings,"Making up 8% of the Earth's crust, Aluminum is the most abundant metal available to us, being less common than only Oxygen and Silicon. However, it is still more expensive than Steel due to the difficulty of extraction -- Aluminum is highly reactive and only exists as compounds that are bound to other elements, making it very energy intensive to separate it chemically into its pure metallic form to be used. However, aluminum products such as cans, wire, or in used phones are extremely easy to recycle as they can simply be melted down and recast as new products."
Arsenic,"Circuit boards, microchips, glass",Poisonous metal used in microchips,"A highly toxic metal, Arsenic is used in the manufacturing of integrated circuit boards and microchips as Gallium Arsenide, a semiconductor compound. The Environmental Protection Agency considers all forms of arsenic to be a serious risk to human health, considers arsenic to be a potent carcinogen. As of 2014, China produced 70% of the world's Arsenic supply, with Morocco, Russia, and Belgium as secondary producers."
Bismuth,Solder,Rare metal used in solder,"Bismuth is relatively inert and does not cause harm. It is used in solder as a replacement for tin, due to its low melting point. Mainly produced in China and Vietnam."
Calcium,Almost all parts,Common metal used in almost all electronic parts,
Carbon,"Circuit boards, batteries, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) components",Common element used in almost all electronic parts,
Chlorine,Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) components,Common element used as fire retardant and in plastic,
Chromium,Case,Rare metal used in casings,"Chromium is an essential component in steel, making up 2-5% depending on the alloy. It is also used frequently in aluminum phone and laptop casings."
Cobalt,Lithium-ion batteries,Highly rare metal used in lithium-ion batteries with exploitative mining process in the third world,"Cobalt makes up about 10% of the mass of a modern lithium-ion battery. A smartphone contains 5-10 grams, a laptop 25-30 grams, and an electric car may contain 15 kilograms. Cobalt is mainly mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where individual ""artisanal"" miners, not employed by any company and with no governmental or commercial oversight, enter unregulated and unsafe mines. These miners use hand tools to mine Cobalt-laden rock, which they then bring back up to the surface and sell to companies that process the ore into cobalt metal. Due to the incredibly dangerous task, miners frequently get injured or even die due to mining accidents. Child labor is also a major issue in the supply chain of cobalt. As of 2012, Apple has agreed with the idea of adding cobalt to the list of conflict minerals due to the humanitarian issues, and does not purchase cobalt mined artisanally from the DRC. However, it has been discovered that this cobalt has still ended up in Apple's devices."
Copper,"Circuit boards, wires, connectors, batteries",,
Gallium,"LEDs, microchips",Common metal used in microchips,"A common, inert metal produced as a byproduct of refining aluminum, Gallium is used in electronics as Gallium Arsenide, a semiconductor compound. Gallium is plentiful in supply, and ethical in consumption since the mining and processing of Aluminum is highly regulated."
Gold,Circuit boards,Gold! 'nuff said.,"Gold! Gold is used in small quantities as connectors or contacts on electronics, due to its extremely low resistance and high thermal tolerance. It is so valuable that even in the tiny amounts that are used, it is still a non-negligible portion of the scrap value of the part. Gold is mainly produced by China and Australia in highly-regulated industrial mines."
Hydrogen,Almost all parts,,
Iron,"Speakers, microphones",,
Lead,Solder,,
Lithium,Lithium-ion batteries,Rare metal used in lithium-ion batteries,"Lithium is a hot topic amongst investors and governments due to its low toxicity, concentration in first-world countries that can easily and safely extract it, and skyrocketing demand due to the proliferation of electronic devices and electronic vehicles. Mainly produced by Australia, Chile, and China, the demand for Lithium is growing at 15% year-on-year and is one of the most expensive elements in a phone."
Magnesium,Case,,
Manganese,"Circuit boards, batteries",Rare metal used in casings,"Manganese is used in aluminium alloys in structures and casings of phones, laptops, and even aircraft. Usually 1-2% by mass, it is often non-substitutable in its applications, and thus is a crucial part of the global supply chain."
Molybdenum,"Circuit boards, microchips, glass",Rare metal used in screens,Molybdenum is used to coat most displays in order to resist oil or water corrosion.
Nickel,"Capacitors, batteries",,
Oxygen,Almost all parts,,
Phosphorus,Microchips,,
Potassium,Glass,,
Silicon,"Circuit boards, microchips, glass",Silicon is the backbone of all electronics!,"There's a reason why it's called ""Silicon Valley"". Silicon is the basis on which modern technology is built upon, and we are lucky that it is one of the most common substances on Earth."
Sulfur,Chips,,
Tantalum,"Circuit boards, microchips, capacitors",Very rare metal used in capacitors,"Tantalum, one of the US-recognized conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold), is the best performing material for capacitors, a key component of most high-performance electronics. It is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where its sale funds military actions in a war amongst the DRC, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), and ISIL and occupying armies of mines force civilians to work. As a result, the extraction of conflict minerals is an ongoing humanitarian criss with no solution in sight. In the US, it is mandatory for companies to trace and disclose conflict minerals used in their products. However, because of the chaotic nature of the DRC and lack of transparency in the small-scale mining operations, reporting is extremely difficult and an accurate account is nearly impossible even if major companies acted in good faith. Thus, the reality is that these materials remain in use in most top-end consumer electronics to this day in the first world."
